1. `/api/ai/repository-summary` - Generates brief repository summaries
2. `/api/ai/repository-analysis` - Provides comprehensive repository analysis
3. `/api/repository/structure` - Fetches repository file structure from GitHub
4. `/api/repository/languages` - Gets language statistics from GitHub
5. `/api/ai/file-analysis` - Analyzes individual files

### Frontend Components:
- Enhanced repository search with scope toggle
- AI Summarizer modal with tabbed interface
- Interactive file explorer with collapsible folders
- Language visualization charts
- Responsive and animated UI elements

### Styling Enhancements:
- Gradient backgrounds for AI features
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Color-coded language indicators
- Loading states with spinners
- Hover effects and interactive feedback

## üìù Usage Instructions

### To Test Public/Private Search:
1. Open the application at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Select "Public" for global search or "Organization" for org-specific search
3. If "Organization" is selected, enter the organization name
4. Enter your search keyword and click "Find Repos"

### To Use AI Summarizer:
1. Search for repositories
2. Click the "AI Summary" button on any repository card
3. Explore the three tabs: Overview, Structure, and Languages
4. Click on files in the Structure tab for detailed analysis

### To View Repository Summary:
1. Select a repository from search results
2. The AI summary automatically appears below the selected repository
3. Shows a concise 100-word description of the repository

## üîß Configuration Notes

- AI responses are currently using mock data for demonstration
- In production, integrate with OpenAI, Anthropic, or other AI services
- GitHub API rate limits apply to structure and language fetching
- File tree depth is limited to 2 levels to avoid rate limiting

## üé® UI/UX Highlights

- **Intuitive Toggle**: Clear visual distinction between public and organization search
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Organization field only appears when needed
- **Rich Interactions**: Hover effects, animations, and loading states
- **Tabbed Interface**: Organized information in the AI modal
- **Visual Language Stats**: Bar charts and cards for language distribution
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes

## üö¶ Testing

A test file `test-features.html` has been created to verify all new endpoints and features. Open it in a browser while the server is running to test each feature individually.

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

1. **Real AI Integration**: Connect to OpenAI/Anthropic for actual AI summaries
2. **Caching**: Store AI analyses to reduce API calls
3. **Deep File Analysis**: Analyze code quality, complexity, and patterns
4. **Dependency Graphs**: Visualize project dependencies
5. **Contributor Analysis**: Show top contributors and activity
6. **Code Snippets**: Display relevant code examples from repositories
7. **Export Features**: Download analyses as PDF or Markdown
